## Description ##
This curriculum module contains a [MATLAB&reg; app](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html) and a [live script](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that follow J.J. Thomsonâ€™s landmark experiment to measure the charge to mass ratio of the electron, e/m. The app is a virtual replacement for the experimental apparatus commonly used in physics laboratories. The live script contains a manual for conducting the experiment. This lab includes background, pre-lab, virtual experiment, and data analysis sections and concludes with an application of the theory to mass spectrometry.

**Learning Goals**
- Explain the forces present in the experimental apparatus
- Derive the physical relationships required to compute the e/m ratio
- Use the app to perform the experiment
- Estimate the value of e/m
- Compute the experimental error and discuss its sources
- Relate the underlying theory to mass spectrometry

## Details ##

**`emLab.mlx, emLabSoln.mlx`**  
A lab manual for the virtual experiment. This live script includes a background description, pre-lab questions, a guide to the virtual experiment, and details on how to process and analyze the data.

## ##
**`emApparatus.mlapp`**  
A MATLAB app that contains a virtual reproduction of the experimental apparatus. Details concerning how to use the app are included in `emLab.mlx`.

## ##
**`emExpSoln.mat`**  
Example measurements taken from the app used in the solution script, `emLabSoln.mlx`.
