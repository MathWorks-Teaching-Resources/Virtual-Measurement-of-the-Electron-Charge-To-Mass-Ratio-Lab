**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2021a. Compatible with R2021a and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) and [MATLAB® app](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html) that follow J.J. Thomson’s landmark experiment to measure the charge to mass ratio of the electron, e/m. 

<a name="H_F00D98E4"></a>
## Background

The app is a virtual replacement for the experimental apparatus commonly used in physics laboratories. The live script contains a manual for conducting the experiment. This lab includes background, pre-lab, virtual experiment, and data analysis sections and concludes with an application of the theory to mass spectrometry.


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/image_0.png" width="19" alt="image_0.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Contact Us

Solutions are available upon instructor request. Contact the [MathWorks teaching resources team](mailto:onlineteaching@mathworks.com) if you would like to request solutions, provide feedback, or if you have a question.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the [<img src="Images/image_1.png" width="136" alt="image_1.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Virtual-Measurement-of-the-Electron-Charge-To-Mass-Ratio-Lab&project=virtual-measurement-of-the-electron-charge-to-m.prj) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double-click on [virtual-measurement-of-the-electron-charge-to-m.prj](matlab: openProject("virtual-measurement-of-the-electron-charge-to-m.prj")). It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start. 


Ensure you have all the required products ([listed below](#H_E850B4FF)) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add-On Explorer. To install an add-on, go to the **Home** tab and select  <img src="Images/image_2.png" width="16" alt="image_2.png"> **Add-Ons** > **Get Add-Ons**.
